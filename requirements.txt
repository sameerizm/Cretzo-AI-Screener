# SAFE AI VERSION - Gradual upgrade approach
# Start with core, add AI features progressively

# Core web framework (guaranteed to work)
fastapi==0.68.0
uvicorn==0.15.0

# Basic document processing (lightweight, no compilation)
python-dateutil==2.8.1

# Optional: Add these ONE BY ONE after core deployment works
# Uncomment gradually in subsequent deployments:

# Step 1: Uncomment for basic document processing
# pdfplumber==0.7.4
# python-docx==0.8.11

# Step 2: Uncomment for PDF reports  
# fpdf==2.5.4

# Step 3: Uncomment for AI features (last step)
